Accuracy for our final model 21% higher than Baseline dummy model.

According to our bar chart, the percentage of correct prediction for both functional and non-functional were both descent

## Limitation and Future plan

For the limitation, the biggest limitation would be data point as I mentioned. Something about the original data was not that good so We create a function trying to find product category better and only have 1348 nans which is 4000 nans less compared with the original dataset. Another limitation would be the percentage of positive emotion is very high shown from the previous slides. So, in the future with more time and money, we want to add more datapoints and continue refining the model. Maybe trying multi class model with neutral emotion to make our model more powerful.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, our model had a solid performance about predicting the emotion from a tweet. By using our model, Apple marking department could instantly find out the thoughts from people about specific product like ipad or iphone. And then they can decide if are going to Increase production on products who with more positive emotion. Or maybe contact technical department to make improvement on products with more negative emotion.
